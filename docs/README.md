## LibSass documentation

Welcome to LibSass, the C library to compile your awesome sass style-sheets
to css. LibSass in itself is only a library and doesn't do much on its own
without an implementor. SassC is such an implementer written in C. There are
a plethora of other implementations - for example NodeJS, python or perl.
We encourage you to write your own - the whole point of LibSass is that we
want to bring Sass to many other languages!

## LibSass road-map 2021

Since ruby-sass was retired in 2019 in favor of dart-sass, we are slowly
moving toward full compatibility with the latest Sass specifications.

### Implementing LibSass

If you're interested in implementing LibSass in your own project, see the
[API Documentation](api-doc.md) which now include implementing your own
[Sass functions](api-function.md). Or you may wish to [look at other
implementations](implementations.md) for your language of choice.
